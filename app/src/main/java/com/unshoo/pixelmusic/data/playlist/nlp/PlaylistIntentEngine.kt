 * Design goals:
 *  - **Semantic reach without an LLM**: mood/intent is matched via stemmed synonyms and
 *    multi-word phrases ([MoodProfile]), so "tunes to lift weights to" triggers the workout
 *    profile even though the words "workout"/"gym" never appear.
 *  - **Accent/inflection tolerance**: both sides go through [NlpText.normalize] + stemming,
 *    so "melancólico" == "melancolico" and "relajantes" ~ "relajante".
 *  - **Rarity-aware weighting**: text matches are scaled by [LibraryIndex.termWeight] so a
 *    rare artist name outranks a common word like "love" in a title.
 *  - **Graceful degradation**: measured BPM and vibe inputs are optional; without them the
 *    engine scores on genre-derived energy and text/behavioral signals alone.
