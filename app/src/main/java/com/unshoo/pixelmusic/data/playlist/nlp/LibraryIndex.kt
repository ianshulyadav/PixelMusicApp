 *    band name) counts far more than matching a ubiquitous one ("love", "remix").
 *  - [knownGenres]: the set of genres actually present in the user's library, used for the

 * Building is O(N × tokens); the result is immutable and cached by [signatureOf] so that the
 * common case (library unchanged between requests) skips the build entirely — important for
 * large libraries where the caller may be invoked repeatedly.
